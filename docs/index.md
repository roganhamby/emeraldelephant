![https://github.com/roganhamby/emeraldelephant/blob/master/Azzuri_medium.png]()Welcome to Emerald Elephants.  The goal of this blog is to demystify some of the workings of the Evergreen ILS database which runs on PostgreSQL.  Evergreen = Emerald, Postgres' mascot is an Elephant.  No, I don't think I'm clever but I'm a sucker for allieration.  After a few years of teaching SQL for librarians classes and periodically getting questions about some of the corners of the Evergreen database I thought, why answer questions individually when I can compile them for posterity and force Github's corporate owners to pay one billionth of a penny hosting some more of my text.  Any samples mentioned here will be marked in the appropriate place in the accompanying Github repo @ https://github.com/roganhamby/emeraldelephant.git whose docs/ folder also contains this blog.  But, that's enough recursion for now.

I take questions via the Github issues and via Twitter @roganhamby or email if you can find it (it's not hard).
